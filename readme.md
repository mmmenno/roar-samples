# Some roar Sample Data

In this repository you'll find some sample data that demonstrates the modelling of 'observations' and 'reconstructions' with the [roar ontology](https://w3id.org/roar/).

Allthough a 'sample', all persons, locations and documents in the data are 'real'. This ensures I'm not working with superclean fairytale data. In one way or another, I'm related to most of the people mentioned in the data - by making this a genealogical project it's a more fun for me (and members of my family, I hope).

An application that queries and visualises the data on a map can be found on [hicsuntleones.nl/family-map/](https://hicsuntleones.nl/family-map/), and there's a [git repo of the app](https://github.com/mmmenno/roar-sample-app-addresses) as well.
